# Overview

ElevatorR is an R application developed by Nicolas Pariente. It provides an interactive simulation of the traffic of an elevator in a building throughout one day.
Users can adjust various settings and view a plot of the waiting time people experienced during the simulation.

The project was created as a learning exercise to understand R by using it to generate data and visualize the results as a plot.

Through this project, I learned:

- How to set up R projects in RStudio
- How to declare variables, use conditionals and loops in the R lenguage
- How to implement the shiny library to create a web page using UI and Server functions
- How to generate a plot using R's features
- How to populate plots with data from a dataframe

# Future Work

- Allow users to download a CSV file with the collected data
- Display more UI information, such as the total average waiting time throughout the day
- Set a max number of people allowed in the elevator
